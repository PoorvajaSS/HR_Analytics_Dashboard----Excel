# Problem Statement

High employee attrition rates and suboptimal performance can have detrimental effects on organizational effectiveness and morale. The organization faces the challenge of understanding the factors contributing to attrition, identifying patterns in employee performance, and implementing targeted strategies to improve the work environment. The problem is to create an HR analytics solution that not only provides a holistic view of employee data but also allows for in-depth analysis of key performance indicators and their correlations with factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and business travel. The goal is to help the organization reduce attrition rates and enhance overall employee performance by uncovering actionable insights through the exploration of HR data.

# Objective:

The dashboard will leverage key HR-related metrics to provide meaningful insights into various aspects of employee engagement, satisfaction, and overall performance.

1.	Attrition Overview: Display the overall attrition rate and its trend over time.

2.	Employee Demographics: Represent the distribution of employees by age, gender, and education field. Implement filters for users to drill down into specific
    demographic segments.

4.	Performance Metrics: Showcase performance metrics such as average monthly income, hourly rate, and percent salary hike.

5.	Job Satisfaction and Involvement: Visualize job satisfaction and job involvement scores for different job roles. Allow users to explore correlations between job satisfaction, job involvement, and attrition.

6.	Work-Life Balance Analysis: Depict work-life balance ratings across different departments. Explore the impact of work-life balance on attrition rates.
